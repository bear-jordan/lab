# Bubbletea

## Goals

Okay, so two big goals here. I want to get better at developing TUIs and CLI tools, and I want to get more comfortable with go. After exploring around, I found the Bubbletea library. Their community outreach and documentation looked great, so it seemed like an easy choice to dive in. After playing around with it more, I realized I could link up Bubbletea and Cobra. Pretty excellent combination.

Eventually, I would like to use this to build a tool that profiles a dbt manifest and gives you an easy way to explore what is going on.

## Basic Model

This is the most simple model I could think to build. The focus here was really just to learn the rudiments and what minimal set of code is needed to create a functioning program.

## Basic Keymap

Now that a basic model was up and running, I wanted to figure out how to trigger different events in the program. Central to this idea is developing a keymap. I spent a few iterations figuring out what felt the best.

## Paragraphs

After working with keymaps, the next challenge was figuring out how to use `bubbles` (pre-built models Charm maintains). The biggest challenge was learning how to route different commands and understanding which needed to be pushed to the bubble.


## Accordian

This is a work in progress, but I'm trying to build a collapsing menu.
