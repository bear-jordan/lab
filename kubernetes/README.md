# Kubernetes

## Environment

For simplicty, I have been using Rancher to create a sandbox Kubernetes cluster. It was fast to spin up and I've enjoyed working with it so far.

## nginx.yaml

In this toy example, I used a `kubectl` dry run to generate a minimal yaml configuration for a pod and played around with some of the tags.

## nginx-deploy.yaml

Scaling up a bit. Instead of just creating one pod, I'm making a whole deployment.
