# Kubernetes

## Environment

For simplicty, I have been using Rancher to create a sandbox Kubernetes cluster. It was fast to spin up and I've enjoyed working with it so far.

## Nginx

I wanted to play around with basic networking. I made this nginx deployment. Learned that you can't expose ports under 1024 without root priviledges, so had to bump to a higher port.


## Mealie

Checking out creating namespaces and using the [Mealie](https://hub.docker.com/r/hkotel/mealie) container.
